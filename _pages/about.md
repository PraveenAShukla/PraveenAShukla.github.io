Hi, I'm Praveen Shukla—an AI & Data Science undergrad at MBZUAI in Abu Dhabi. I work on graph deep learning, LLM agents, and healthcare AI, aiming to build ML systems that reason over real-world data and stay useful in production.

What I’m working on
------
- Graph representation learning for biology and healthcare data
- Retrieval + agentic workflows with LLMs
- Practical ML systems: evaluation, data quality, and fast iteration

Latest publication
------
- **EdgeRAG: Packable, Offline, and Fair Retrieval-Augmented Micro-Models for Low-Connectivity Regions** — accepted at AAAI 2026 EGSAI Workshop. [Read more](/publication/2025-11-20-edgerag-egsai-2026).

Recent highlights
------
- Built and shipped LLM agent workflows for research productivity
- Exploring graph neural networks for patient trajectories and molecular data
- Open to collaborations on applied AI in healthcare and robust evaluation

Education
------
- B.S. in AI & Data Science (undergraduate), MBZUAI — Abu Dhabi
